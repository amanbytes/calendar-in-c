# calendar-in-c

### A simple calendar created by me using C language. :blush:

I've changed some code for linux systems and added `conio.h` file for `getch` that I've used in both C files. Make sure that `conio.h` file present in this repository is also available when you compile this C file in linux systems.

If you don't want to compile it, then you can use provided precompiled files for both linux and windows system.
